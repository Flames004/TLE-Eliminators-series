# Target Practice
[Problem Link](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1873/C)

A 10×10 target is made out of five "rings" as shown. Each ring has a different point value: the outermost ring — 1 point, the next ring — 2 points, ..., the center ring — 5 points.

Vlad fired several arrows at the target. Help him determine how many points he got.

### Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1≤t≤1000) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of 10 lines, each containing 10 characters. Each character in the grid is either X (representing an arrow) or . (representing no arrow).

### Output
For each test case, output a single integer — the total number of points of the arrows.

### Example

**Input:**
```
