# Problem Solving Progress

This repository serves as a progress tracker for solving competitive programming problems from Codeforces. The problems are categorized based on their difficulty ratings, and my goal is to solve a diverse set of problems while improving my problem-solving skills.

## Problem Sheet Overview

The problem sheet I'm working on contains problems from various difficulty levels on Codeforces. Each problem is chosen to help me practice different algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving techniques commonly used in competitive programming. <br>
You can also give it a try as to improve your skills in competitive programming.

## Progress Sheet

The problems are categorized by their difficulty ratings, and the list will be updated regularly as I solve more problems.

- ðŸŒŸ **Easy (800-1000)**: Problems designed to improve basic logic and introductory techniques.
- ðŸŒŸ **Medium (1100-1300)**: Problems focusing on advanced algorithms, data structures, and math.
- ðŸŒŸ **Hard (1300+)**: Challenging problems that require deeper knowledge of algorithms, optimization, and creative problem-solving.

## Goals

1. Solve a minimum of 7 problems per week across various difficulty levels.
2. Practice and apply different algorithms and techniques.
3. Track progress and reflect on my problem-solving approach.
